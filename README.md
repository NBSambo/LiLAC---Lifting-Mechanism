# LiLAC---Lifting-Mechanism
This code was made through Arduino IDE and made for the lifting mechanism. One ESP is needed to program the two motors.
Input and output variable numbers can be changed depending on what pins you are using.
For any questions or concerns feel free to contact me @ sambon@mcmaster.ca

movetest.ino tests to see if the motor moves correctly, if the polarity is correct, and if the motor specs listed are correct.

motorcontrol.ino tests the button functionality with the motor. t and dt are variables that are determined after testing.

For future considerations and if we had more time, the motorcontrol.ino code would have been expanded so that it would more accurately resemble the pseudocode shown in section III-2.
